Introduction
The RoboShop project demonstrates a typical three-tier application setup, separating concerns into distinct layers: a user-facing web frontend, a business logic backend composed of microservices, and a persistent data storage layer. This repository provides the configuration files and manual steps required to bring this architecture to life on pre-configured Linux servers.

Architecture Overview
The RoboShop application is structured into the following tiers:

Frontend Tier:

Technology: Nginx

Role: Serves the static web assets and acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests to the backend microservices.

Backend Tier:

Technology: Multiple Microservices (details within the backend/ directory)

Role: Handles the core business logic, API endpoints, and interacts with the database. Each microservice typically runs as a separate process.

Database Tier:

Technology: MongoDB (and potentially other NoSQL databases/messaging queues like Redis, RabbitMQ)

Role: Stores application data and manages message queues for inter-service communication.

Features
Clear separation of concerns across three tiers.

Nginx configuration for robust frontend serving and proxying.

Modular setup for various backend microservices.

Database configurations for MongoDB.

Manual deployment guide for hands-on learning and control.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the deployment, ensure you have:

Provisioned Linux Servers: You will need at least three (or more, depending on your microservice distribution) Linux servers, manually provisioned, for each tier. These servers should be reachable via SSH.

Reference: This repository assumes you are following a separate manual guide for provisioning your base Linux servers. Ensure they have basic network configuration, SSH access, and an updated package list.

SSH Client: A working SSH client on your local machine to connect to the servers.

Basic Linux Command Line Knowledge: Familiarity with Linux commands for file operations, package management, and service control.

Network Access: Ensure your local machine can reach your provisioned servers over the necessary ports (SSH, HTTP/S, application-specific ports).

Repository Structure
The repository is structured to separate configurations for each tier and component.

Deployment Guide
Follow these steps to deploy the RoboShop application on your manually provisioned Linux servers.

Step 1: Manual Server Provisioning
Ensure you have your Linux servers ready for each tier (e.g., one for Frontend, one for Backend, one for Database). This repository does not automate the creation of the underlying VMs/servers but provides configurations for them once they are running.

Frontend Server: (e.g., frontend.example.com or 192.168.1.10)

Backend Server: (e.g., backend.example.com or 192.168.1.20)

Database Server: (e.g., database.example.com or 192.168.1.30)

Step 2: Clone this Repository
On each of your provisioned Linux servers, clone this repository:

sudo yum install git  # For CentOS/RHEL
sudo apt install git  # For Ubuntu/Debian
git clone https://github.com/Nallagachu/RoboShop.git
cd RoboShop

Step 3: Frontend (Nginx) Setup
Execute the following commands on your Frontend Server:

Install Nginx:

sudo yum install nginx -y # For CentOS/RHEL
# OR
sudo apt install nginx -y # For Ubuntu/Debian

Copy Nginx Configuration:

sudo cp frontend/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
# OR if using sites-available/sites-enabled
# sudo cp frontend/roboshop.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/roboshop.conf
# sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/roboshop.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/roboshop.conf
# sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Place Web Assets (if applicable):
If your frontend nginx.conf expects static assets, copy them to the specified location (e.g., /usr/share/nginx/html/):

# Example: If your static files are in frontend/roboshop-web-assets/
sudo cp -r frontend/roboshop-web-assets/* /usr/share/nginx/html/

Start and Enable Nginx:

sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

Step 4: Backend (Microservices) Setup
Execute the following commands on your Backend Server (and potentially other servers if microservices are distributed):

Install Runtime & Dependencies:
Depending on your microservice technologies, install Node.js, Java, Python, etc.

Example (Node.js):

# You might have a script in backend/common-scripts/install-nodejs.sh
# sudo bash backend/common-scripts/install-nodejs.sh
# Or manually:
sudo yum install nodejs -y # For CentOS/RHEL
# OR
sudo apt install nodejs -y # For Ubuntu/Debian

Configure and Deploy Microservices:
For each microservice, navigate to its directory, install dependencies, and set up its execution.

Example for a Node.js microservice (e.g., users):

cd backend/users/
npm install
# Configure environment variables if needed (e.g., database connection string)
# Setup a systemd service to keep it running
# sudo cp backend/users/users.service /etc/systemd/system/users.service
# sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# sudo systemctl enable users
# sudo systemctl start users

Repeat this for each microservice (catalogue, payment, etc.) present in your backend/ directory.

Step 5: Database (MongoDB) Setup
Execute the following commands on your Database Server:

Install MongoDB:

Example:

# You might have a script in database/setup-db.sh
# sudo bash database/setup-db.sh
# Or follow MongoDB's official installation guide for your Linux distribution.

Configure MongoDB:
Modify the MongoDB configuration file if needed (e.g., database/mongodb.conf).

sudo cp database/mongodb.conf /etc/mongod.conf # Or relevant path

Start and Enable MongoDB:

sudo systemctl enable mongod
sudo systemctl start mongod

Initialize Database (if necessary):
Run any initial setup scripts for your database, like creating users or populating initial data.

Step 6: Other Components (Optional)
If your architecture includes messaging queues (like RabbitMQ) or caching services (like Redis):

Execute relevant setup scripts from your messaging/ directory on the appropriate server(s).

Example: sudo bash messaging/rabbitmq-setup.sh

Configure services and ensure they start on boot.

Step 7: Network & Firewall Configuration
Ensure necessary ports are open between your tiers and to the outside world.

Frontend Server:

Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) inbound from the internet.

Allow connections to Backend microservice ports (e.g., 8080, 9000, etc.) outbound.

Backend Server(s):

Allow connections from Frontend (Nginx) on microservice ports.

Allow connections to Database (MongoDB 27017) and Messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ 5672, Redis 6379) ports outbound.

Database Server:

Allow connections from Backend on MongoDB's default port (27017).

Allow connections from Backend on Messaging service ports (if on the same server).

You might have a script like common/firewall-setup.sh to configure firewalld or ufw.

Customization & Configuration
Service Configurations: Each microservice within the backend/ directory likely has its own configuration files (e.g., config.js, .env files, or JSON configs). Modify these files to adjust database connections, API keys, or service-specific settings.

Nginx Vhost: Adjust frontend/nginx.conf (or separate virtual host files) to match your domain names and backend service locations.

Environment Variables: Use environment variables where sensitive data (e.g., database passwords) or environment-specific values are needed.

Troubleshooting
Check Service Status: Use sudo systemctl status <service_name> (e.g., nginx, mongod, users) to check if services are running.

Review Logs: Check service logs for errors (e.g., journalctl -u nginx, /var/log/nginx/error.log, microservice specific logs).

Network Connectivity: Use ping, telnet, or nc (netcat) to test connectivity between servers on required ports.

Firewall Rules: Verify firewall rules on all servers are not blocking necessary traffic.
